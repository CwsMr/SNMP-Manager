# SNMP-Manager
snmp protocol manager
This simple "linux-based" desktop application like other management tools, PowerSNMP for example.
I focused  on the manager side only not the agen.

The application GUI  handle the following: 
1- Determine the IP address for the target agent.
2- Select the version of snmp.
3- Enter all information related to the security of snmp based on the version selected by the user.
4- Show a list of MIB objects to be managed. The list should contain common MIB 
5- perform scanning the network and show up hosts
